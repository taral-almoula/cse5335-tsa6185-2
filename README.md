# What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
I found the aspects that were similar to previous project relatively easier. Also, connecting with mongoDb and interacting with mongoDb was relatively easy too.

#What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why? 
Integrating MongoDb with the webpage/webapp was a little tricky. And also took me a little time on solving the animation and 20 entries per page part.

#If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern? 
I think proper and smooth integration of these technologies will be a concern. Every technology has a different compatibility with other technologies, some might not even be compatible or face compatibility issues which needs to be solved. So,selecting the set of technologies would be my biggest concern professionally.
